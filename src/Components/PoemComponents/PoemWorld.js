        I wouldn't go to college
        With Skin in the game
        I'd sign an ISA 
        or backpack through Africa
        You see I don't have all the answers
        Barely have the questions
        But when I muster up enough gusto 
        to go out and live life
        to take chances, calculated risk
        that's when I feel most alive
        So maybe everything isn't a slam dunk
        But you don't know until you try`
