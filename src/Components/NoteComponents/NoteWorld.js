        try this and that. But when school is over, the student must 
        live out the most attractive ideas in that experimentation process.
        This is challenging because experimentation is often times the most 
        exciting, where true expertise lies embedded deep within the minutia of
        a topic. There's a narrowing in everything from sexual partners
        to areas of study. In some sense we have to find a balance between 
        experimentation and exploitation throughout our entire lives
        in order to keep our mind engaged and for us to feel fulfilled.
