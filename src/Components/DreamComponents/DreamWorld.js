         I dreamt that I was back at Wesleyan watching Lamars practice.
         The campus looked like GA's. Then I was walking around and I met this
         tall girl who I first thought was a boy. We made out a bit and wanted
         to go somewhere, we walked around but the athetic fields looked crowded.
         We split up and I got back in my escalade to meet her at the gym.
         I drove fast and the car flipped over going down a hill. I walked
         to this bodega, than I walked around the gym looking for her and I saw 
         Nicky who told me to meditate outside. I called my mom about the accident
         and started walking back to see if it actually happened. `

        I had a dream that I was at Carson Valley,
        but the building looked different, I know I had been fired so I was hanging around
        saying goodbye to people. I remember saying goodbye and thanking Tina for the peaches.
        I had a boner when I hugged her and she noticed. I thanked Donna too. Then I was in a concrete basement of Carsons
        that was very dirty. I had eaten some fast food amongst rats and mice and other things. I left the trash down
        there and wandered around. I knew I'd have to go get it. After a while, I went back to go get my trash`
